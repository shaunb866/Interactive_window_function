# Interactive_window_function

Code to take the input of an interactive window function and calcuate the spearman rank coefficent (quoted as log(1-rho)) for the given window function provided. We want rho=1, in a perfect world, so we want to minimise log(1-rho). FOr reference a vlaue of log(1-rho)=-2 would be pretty good, but ideally we would have log(1-rho)~-2.5

To run the code open up the jupyter notebook and simple run the one cell. Has to be run in jupyter notebook with an ipython terminal for the interactivity to work properly.
